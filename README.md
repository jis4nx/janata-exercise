## Challenges Faced

- Visualizing Huge amount of data points with React.

## What I Learnt
I struggled to plot large numbers of data points. I was having trouble controlling pagination and visualizing them in a user-friendly fashion. So, after trial and error, I learned a little about the React apex chart. I couldn't master it due to time constraints. But I will definitely look into this. Overall, I enjoyed working on this project :) .
